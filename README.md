# Sarcina - Puzzle Game made in C#


Sarcina is a puzzle game made in C#. Your objective is to deliver parcels to designated places just like in classic Sokoban. An additional difficulty are portals connecting normally inaccessible areas. Correct delivery of parcels will require exploring a map to find all traps and determine shortest path in this hostile environment. The more progress you make, the more insidious portals become.

*Will you let a sudden change of envoirement confuse you and prevent your delivery?*

Don't worry! Sarcina won't leave you completely without a chance to fight against the interdimensional element. There are terminals on maps that can completely change rules of the game! Once the package with the symbol of an object has been put into terminal, the object will change its properties. The right terminal will let you cross walls or carry more than one package. **But watch out!** a package placed in a terminal may still be needed for delivery to the correct destination.

**Rise to the challenge and become the galxy's best supplier!**

### Inspiration

Sarcina implements 4 pillars of Object Oriented Programming, as it was designed as final project for OOP course at University of Technology. Project is inspired by games like: *Sokoban*, *Portal* and *Baba is You*. 

We used this project as an opportunity to learn more about Unit Testing.
